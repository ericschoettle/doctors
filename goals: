What I want my code to do:

1. Get doctors based on a fixed location and a query for search.
2. Separate front end and back end, so that the form is handled on the front end and the API call on the back end, with the results printed via a callback to the front end.
3. Gather the coordinates of the search results
4. Loop through the search result coordinates, plotting them on a map with google maps API.
5. Give those markers numbers so that they can match up with the list of doctors I'm returning. Or even better, give them links to more info on the doctors.
6. Use IP address location to look up user location, and feed that in to the search.

Other things I need to do:

1. Git commits.
2. README
3. Styling
4. submit on epicenter.
